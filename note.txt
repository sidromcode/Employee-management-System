IF THERE IS NO ERROR IN THE CODE AND STILL IT SHOWS ERROR WHILE YOU TRY TO START THE SERVER, THEN IT MEANS THAT THE PORT YOU ARE USING TO OCCUPY IS IN PROCESS 
FOR EXAMPLE PORT:3000

THEN RUN THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS NOT IN BASH BUT IN POWERSHELL TERMINAL 
STEP 1- "COMMAND":  netstat -ano | findstr :ENTER THE POR ID  :eg :  netstat -ano | findstr :3001  //the spaces inbetween the comment should be exactly like in the example
output :   TCP    0.0.0.0:3001           0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       17808
  TCP    [::]:3001              [::]:0                 LISTENING       17808

  here listening is the pip
